# Transfer Learning with VGG16 for Cats vs Dogs Classification

## Overview
This repository contains code for performing image classification on the Cats vs Dogs dataset using transfer learning with the VGG16 model. Transfer learning is a technique where a pre-trained model is used as a starting point for a new task, allowing the model to leverage knowledge learned from a previous related task. VGG16 is a popular deep convolutional neural network architecture that has been pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset.

The code downloads the Cats vs Dogs dataset from Kaggle, preprocesses the data, fine-tunes the VGG16 model, and evaluates its performance on a validation set.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Matplotlib
- Kaggle API key (for downloading the dataset)
